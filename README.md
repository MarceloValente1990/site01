At the beginning of the Software Developer course, I had the opportunity to complete my first practical assignment: building the front-end of a website. For this project, we used a layout provided by the instructor, available on the Figma platform:  https://www.figma.com/design/j3a8zRO9N8fYDaFr1FkmKr/LandPage?node-id=0-1&t=M2uqWfUijnIyf3yg-1.
The challenge was to turn this visual design into functional code, creating an interface that stayed true to the original model.
To develop the project, I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, along with a bit of JavaScript to add some basic interactivity. It was my first time working with Bootstrap, and I must admit I had some difficulty understanding how to use it properly—especially when it came to making the site responsive, ensuring it looked good on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
Despite the challenges—particularly with structuring columns, aligning elements, and adapting the layout to different screen sizes—I gradually learned through testing and trial and error. In the end, I was able to deliver a functional and responsive website with a look very close to the original Figma design.
This project was a truly enriching experience. Besides putting into practice what I had learned in class, I was able to develop essential skills for web development, such as interpreting UI layouts, using CSS frameworks, and paying attention to visual details. It was a great start and left me even more motivated for future challenges.
